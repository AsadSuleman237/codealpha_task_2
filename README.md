ðŸ“Š Educational Performance and Resource Allocation Dashboard

This repository contains my Power BI project for **CodeAlpha Task 2**, focused on analyzing student academic performance and resource distribution across rural and urban regions.

The dashboard was developed to:
- Evaluate student performance across various metrics.
- Analyze resource usage in educational institutions.
- Compare performance between **rural and urban** regions.
- Support data-driven decisions in education management.
